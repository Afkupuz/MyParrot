# MyParrot
Swift app that repeats what you record and modifies it

I created this app while following the free Udacity IOS development course. Initially, I built it and accidentaly deleted it when I tried to upload it to github, so this is actually my second version.  

##Version:  
Xcode version 7.2.1
App developed for IOS version 9.4

##Features:
This app lets you record a single audio file and then play it back  
Change the speed of the playback  
Change the pitch of the playback  
Change the reverb of the playback  
Added switches to create a cathedral reverb effect, echo, metalic voice, and robot voice

##Issues:
The code for the switches is clunkly at best, only one of the echo, metal, or robot mods can be on at once so they automatically shut off when play is pushed if more than one is on.
